      <h2>The Computer</h2>
      <p>First generation computers that were invented use of vacuum tubes, they were expensive, and bulky. They used machine language for computing. This could only solve one problem at a time. They couldnâ€™t support multitasking. The use of transistors began the second generation of computers. These computers used punched cards for input. They used assembly language. Integrated circuits ushered in the third generation of computers. Their use increased the speed and efficiency of computers, and operating systems were the human interface to computing operations. Keyboards and monitors became the input-output devices. Introduction of microprocessors began the fourth generation computers. Microprocessor are thousands of integrated circuits placed onto a silicon chip. The fifth generation computers are now. They are capable of massive parallel processing, understand natural language, and support voice recognition. The current advancements of the computer are transforming computing machines into intelligent ones. These possess self-organizing skills. The evolution of computers will continue to advance and surprise the world!</p>
