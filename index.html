      <h2>The Computer</h2>
      <p>First generation computers that were invented use of vacuum tubes, they were expensive, and bulky. They used machine language for computing. This could only solve one problem at a time. They couldn’t support multitasking. The use of transistors began the second generation of computers. These computers used punched cards for input. They used assembly language. Integrated circuits ushered in the third generation of computers. Their use increased the speed and efficiency of computers, and operating systems were the human interface to computing operations. Keyboards and monitors became the input-output devices. Introduction of microprocessors began the fourth generation computers. Microprocessor are thousands of integrated circuits placed onto a silicon chip. The fifth generation computers are now. They are capable of massive parallel processing, understand natural language, and support voice recognition. The current advancements of the computer are transforming computing machines into intelligent ones. These possess self-organizing skills. The evolution of computers will continue to advance and surprise the world!</p>

      <h2>The Phone</h2>
      <p>The earliest cell phones were called “car phones”. They were too large and bulky to carry around in a pocket or purse. In 1983, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x was invented. It was considered to be the first mobile phone because it was small enough to take around. The early cell phones were meant for just calling, but soon they developed into many more things. It started with voice mail. Then they added emails, fax machine papers, and contact book. Then they just kept adding more to this day. The technology is not the only thing that change over time. The shape of the phone has changed. It went from being a big bulk giant phone to a miniature device over the years. They’ve have recently just began to get larger. The cell phone has changed so much and developed so quick in the past decade that it seems anything you can imagine is possible in the future.</p>

      <h2>The Camera</h2>
      <p>The evolution of the camera has changed since the very first versions of the camera. Though considered creative in their time. It would been very crude instruments of photography compared to the advanced cameras that are out today. The very first camera was obscura, the pinhole camera. The device uses a pinhole to project the image but ended projecting upside down.The first compact cameras were Kodak and Brownie, but they weren’t very compact. The comfortability of the camera and portability would be more attractive to more buyers who are want to create photographs of their own.The Franke & Heidecke Rolleiflex TLR, twin-lens reflex camera, were known to have been the first practical reflex camera. TLRs and SLRs or single-lens reflex cameras both have bulkier styles than the box-type Kodak and other more portable cameras. Instant cameras had the ability to print pictures with out having the film taken out. Digital cameras are some of the most advanced ones because they no longer use film for storing images, but use memory cards or internal storage for keeping the photos.</p>

      <h2>The Car</h2>
      <p>The first cars were powered by steam engines back in the 1700s, Karl Benz in 1885 who invented the first gas-powered car. Benz’s first car had three wheels, looked much like an elongated tricycle, but only sat two people. T Thanks to Ford’s invention of the assembly line, cars we able to be mass-produced, and became affordable to the general population. And, along with mass production came new features, some of the first being speedometers, seatbelts, windshields, and rear-view mirrors.hanks to Ford’s invention of the assembly line, cars we able to be mass-produced, and became affordable to the general population.
